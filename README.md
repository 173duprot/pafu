### Abstract
This was originally an idea I had about building a fedarated text chat built around syncing text files, however it quickly expanded scope once I realized that I could sync directories, which can contain literally anything you want. This document outlines how to impliment a full fedarated network where you can watch videos, blog, tweet, have chats, and even live steam using nothing but unix tools and low cost low power servers.

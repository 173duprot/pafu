### Abstract
This was originally an idea I had about building a fedarated text chat built around syncing text files, however it quickly expanded scope once I realized that I could sync directories, which can contain literally anything you want.

This document outlines how to impliment a full fedarated network where you can
 - watch videos
 - blog
 - tweet
 - chats (with text, images, videos, and links)
 - and even live steam
 
 using nothing but unix tools (and stuff like lsyncd) and low cost low power servers.
